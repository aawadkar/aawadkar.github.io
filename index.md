Hello people! I am Aayush from Chicago! :)

### Programing

I love programming in Python and I am starting to learn GitHub! This is my first Python code.

```python
import turtle

star = turtle.Turtle()

for i in range(50):
  star.forward(50)
  star.forward(144) 

turtle.done()
```
For the full code, contact me! 

### Hobbies

I enjoy playing cricket and basketball! I like solving Rubix cubes too when I'm bored! 

### Music I like

I like listening to rap and I also enjoy rock! I don't like my dad's favourite songs :) No, I'm just kidding! He is "Daddy Cool!"
